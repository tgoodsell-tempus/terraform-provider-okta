### Nested Schema for `password_hash`

Required:

- `algorithm` (String) The algorithm used to generate the hash using the password
- `value` (String) For SHA-512, SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5, This is the actual base64-encoded hash of the password (and salt, if used). This is the Base64 encoded value of the SHA-512/SHA-256/SHA-1/MD5 digest that was computed by either pre-fixing or post-fixing the salt to the password, depending on the saltOrder. If a salt was not used in the source system, then this should just be the the Base64 encoded value of the password's SHA-512/SHA-256/SHA-1/MD5 digest. For BCRYPT, This is the actual radix64-encoded hashed password.

Optional:

- `salt` (String) Only required for salted hashes
- `salt_order` (String) Specifies whether salt was pre- or postfixed to the password before hashing
- `work_factor` (Number) Governs the strength of the hash and the time required to compute it. Only required for BCRYPT algorithm
